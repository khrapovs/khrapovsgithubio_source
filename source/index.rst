Stanislav Khrapov
=================

My name is Stanislav Khrapov. I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at the `New Economic School in Moscow, Russia <http://www.nes.ru/en/home/>`_. I specialize in the area of financial economics and econometrics. My primary `research interests <research.html>`_ include but not limited to long-term asset pricing, option pricing, and volatility modeling. Take a look at my `full resume <_static/Stanislav_Khrapov_CV.pdf>`_.

Besides that, I am a big fan of Python for scientific computing. Some of the code is publicly available on my `Github repository <https://github.com/khrapovs>`_.

On the personal level I love travel photography. Take a look at my G+ profile if you are interested. Finally, I run and swim a lot. You can join me in this passion on `Strava <https://www.strava.com/athletes/6131284>`_.
